This is an app that allows you to search users' captions (unlike Instagram's main search, which only allows you to search hashtags).

By giving the user,pass of an Instagram account and your target accounts and a keyword, you will see subtitles and links related to that keyword.

Ù”Note: Giving the Instagram user,pass doesn't seem very safe, but that's due to Instagram API rules and the user,pass is never stored anywhere.
